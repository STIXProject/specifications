# STIX Specifications
DRAFT STIX specification documents for version 1.1.1

This repository contains a DRAFT UML data model for STIX 1.1.1, together with accompanying specification documentation. This effort is to lay the foundation for future work and describes only the *current* state of the language.

When the final specification is completed, it will be updated to describe STIX version 1.2.  Because STIX version 1.2 is under development, it would be premature to try to capture any changes it will include. 

### Data Models

The directory *data_models* contains three separate UML models:

* STIX.emx
* CYBOX.emx
* BasicTypes.emx

The data models are represented using XMI.  They were created using Rational Software Architect (RSA).  It is expected that they will be able to be imported into other UML tools.  Currently, there are no diagrams in the CybOX model.

### Specification Documents

The directory *documents* contains the specification documents.  Only the ones listed below in bold are currently available:

* **STIX_Campaign_Draft.docx**
* **STIX_COA_Draft.docx**
* STIX_Common_Draft.docx
* **STIX_Core_Draft.docx**
* STIX_DataMarking_Draft.docx
* **STIX_ExploitTarget_Draft.docx**
* STIX_Extensions_Draft.docx
* **STIX_Incident_Draft.docx**
* **STIX_Indicator_Draft.docx**
* **STIX_SpecOverview_Draft.docx**
* **STIX_ThreatActor_Draft.docx**
* **STIX_TTP_Draft.docx**
* STIX_Vocab_Draft.docx

The subdirectory *pdf versions* contains PDF versions of the available documents.

Observables will be covered in the CybOX specification documents, which will be developed once the STIX specification documents are final.

As drafts, these documents are works in progress â€“ and we expect them to change, perhaps significantly, as we continue their development. Most of all, we expect comments and suggestions from the community to play a large role in refining them. However, our main goal with the release of these draft documents is to be transparent in their development. Basing any implementation on these documents until they are final is *strongly* discouraged.
