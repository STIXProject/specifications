# STIX Specifications
DRAFT STIX specification documents for version 1.2.1

This repository contains a DRAFT UML data model for STIX 1.2.1, together with accompanying specification documentation. 

### Data Models

The directory *data_models* contains three separate UML models:

* STIX.emx
* CYBOX.emx (this is not an official normative model for CybOX but rather just a draft model to help frame the STIX models)
* BasicTypes.emx

The data models are represented using XMI.  They were created using Rational Software Architect (RSA).  It is expected that they will be able to be imported into other UML tools.  Currently, there are no diagrams in the CybOX model.

In addition, we have provided the UML models in UML 2.2 open-source format, which might be easier to import into your UML tool.  However, that format does not support diagrams.

* STIX.uml
* CYBOX.uml (this is not an official normative model for CybOX but rather just a draft model to help frame the STIX models)
* BasicTypes.uml

### Specification Documents

This directory will stage the STIX specification documents using the OASIS format.


Observables will be covered in the CybOX specification documents, which will be developed once the STIX specification documents are final.

Basing an implementation *directly* on these documents is discouraged, as they are drafts.
