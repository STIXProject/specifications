The UML model content provided in this folder is NOT a part of the normative specification for the STIX language.
The normative specification representations of the UML models are present in the "uml model serialization" folder of this repository.

Members of the community are using different UML tools to view these models, therefore two different versions of the 
UML models are available.  Some tools are compatible with Rational Software Architect (RSA), perhaps with the use of additional 
software (adapters) that have to be obtained separately from the basic tool.  Tools that are not compatible might be able to
import files in the UML 2.2 open-source format, but those do not contain the UML diagrams that are used in the specification documents.

* .uml files - Three files in the UML 2.2 open-source format
* .emx files - Three files using the RSA xmi format

The CybOX UML models present here do not represent an official normative model for CybOX but rather are just a draft model to help frame the STIX models.
