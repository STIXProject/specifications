Members of the community are using different UML tools to view these models, therefore two different versions of the 
UML models are available.  Some tools are compatible with Rational Software Architect (RSA), perhaps with the use of additional 
software (adapters) that have to be obtained separately from the basic tool.  Tools that are not compatible might be able to
import files in the UML 2.2 open-source format, but those do not contain the UML diagrams that are used in the specification documents.

* .uml files - Three files in the UML 2.2 open-source format
* .emx files - Three files using the RSA xmi format
